# List of Firefox Security & Privacy Addons

This is a curated list of Firefox security/privacy addons & tweaks.

## Adblockers

While many other addons listed here may have the consequence of blocking ads, these addon's primary purpose is to defeat online advertising.

* [Ublock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) - Efficient adblocker thats easy on memory
* [AdNauseam](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adnauseam/) - Based on UBlock Origin, with the bonus of automatically 'clicking' ads it encounters in the background, giving trackers a hard time.

## Tracking Protection

* [Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/privacy-badger-firefox/) - As you browse, Privacy Badger identifies 3rd party domains that show up around the web, and tries to intelligently disable cookies or entirely block the request. You can also use its simple interface to block domains yourself, although it works pretty well 'out of the box'.
* [Ghostery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/ghostery/) - Another tracker blocker, allows you to block trackers by cateogory.
* [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/) - Replaces many [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) requests with locally loaded content, which speeds up your browsing and prevents some CDN tracking. Decentraleyes is missing many CDNs, however.
